1. 🌐 3D/Canvas Manipulation GesturesThese are essential if your application deals with a 3D environment, a large map, or a creative canvas where rotation and panning are needed.Left Hand (Modifier)Right Hand (Primary Action)Resulting ActionRationaleHold Still (Passive Anchor)Move in Any DirectionPan/ScrollThe "Hold Still" hand acts as an anchor point. Moving the other hand drags the entire canvas relative to that anchor.Hold Still (Anchor Point)Zoom In/OutRotate/SpinWhile one hand is fixed, changing the distance of the other hand (your zoom gesture) can be mapped to rotation around the anchor point.Pinch (Lock Zoom/Scale)Move in Any DirectionScale and MoveThe pinch locks the initial size of an object, and moving the other hand moves the object while maintaining that scale.2. 📝 Complex Selection and Editing GesturesThese gestures combine selection (pinch) with modification (pointing/moving).Left Hand (Modifier)Right Hand (Primary Action)Resulting ActionRationalePinch (Select/Grab)Pinch (Select/Grab)Free-form ResizeGrabbing an object with one hand and then performing a zoom in/out motion with the other hand allows for intuitive resizing, similar to using two fingers on a touch screen.Hold Still (Stabilize Mode)Pointing + MovePrecision Cursor ControlActivating a "Hold Still" on the non-dominant hand reduces the speed or increases the damping of the cursor movement from the pointing hand, allowing for fine-grain accuracy.Pinch (Mode Lock)Pointing + Move"Draw" or Continuous SelectionThe pinch locks the action. Instead of a single "click," the pointer hand now performs a continuous action (like drawing a line or making a marquee selection) until the left hand releases the pinch.3. ⚙️ Mode Switching and System ControlThese can trigger higher-level interface changes that are too complex for a single hand.Left Hand (Modifier)Right Hand (Primary Action)Resulting ActionRationaleHold Still (Gesture Reset)Any Movement/GestureUndo Last ActionA quick reset gesture, where the stabilized hand confirms that the action should be undone.Zoom In (Activation)Pinch (Trigger)Quick Menu Pop-upThis complex sequence is unlikely to happen accidentally. It can be mapped to bring up a specific context menu or tool palette (e.g., Left Hand activates tools, Right Hand selects the tool).Pointing (Source/Target 1)Pointing (Source/Target 2)"Warp" or TeleportPointing at two distant locations simultaneously could be used to warp the cursor from one point to the other (useful for large displays).
