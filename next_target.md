# Extentions:
**1.  Thumbs up. Logic will be simple: if only thumb is extended and thumb tip.y is less than pinky MCP then it's thumbs up**
**2.  Thumbs down. Logic will be simple: if only thumb is extended and thumb tip.y is greater than pinky MCP then it's thumbs down**
**3.  Thumbs up moving up. check if thumbs is up using the previous logic and if the velocity is more than a threshold in the up direction**
**4.  Thumbs up moving down. check if thumbs is up using the previous logic and if the velocity is more than a threshold in the down direction**
**5.  Thumbs down moving up. check if thumbs is down using the previous logic and if the velocity is more than a threshold in the up direction**
**6.  Thumbs down moving down. check if thumbs is down using the previous logic and if the velocity is more than a threshold in the down direction**
