# Issues:
**1. The finger open logic is flawed! it takes one direction and so when the hand is rotated it fails to work! Instead we should use euclidian distance between finger tip and fingers other part of currently the part we are using**
**2. Will make the velocity thresh for swipe to 0.15 so its stable. and need to implement only when all 5 fingers are opened**
